      "Ashwin co-wrote the film's script along with Rutham Samar, Sai Madhav Burra and B. S. Sarawagna Kumar, in his second consecutive film with Samar and Burra after Mahanati.[30][31] A muhurat pooja ceremony was held on 24 July 2021 at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad with the presence of the film's cast and crew. The working title was revealed to have been changed to Project K the same day.[21][32][33] Ashwin stated that the film needed high-end technology and futuristic vehicles to be developed for the film. Although they can be recreated using computer-generated imagery (CGI), the director opted to build these vehicles from scratch.[34]\n",
      "In March 2022, Ashwin requested businessman Anand Mahindra to provide technical support to build such type of vehicles.[35] A few days later, Mahindra responded that their company Mahindra & Mahindra would assist the production team from their Mahindra Research Valley campus in Chennai.[36] In July 2021, the makers erected a futuristic set at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad where a significant portion of filming is expected to take place.[37] A. R. Rahman had been initially approached, in August 2020, to compose music for the film but the talks fell out.[38]\n",
      "Ashwin retained most of his technicians, including composer Mickey J. Meyer, editor Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao, production designer Nithin Zihani Choudhary, cinematographer Dani Sanchez-Lopez, costume designers Thota Vijay Bhaskar, Shaleena Nathani and Sahithi Patha.[39] However, Serbian cinematographer, Djordje Stojiljkovic,[40] replaced Dani Sanchez-Lopez as the official cinematographer of the film. In February 2023, Santhosh Narayanan replaced Meyer as the composer.[41] Andreas Nguyen was chosen as the stunt choreographer of the film.[42] Singeetam Srinivasa Rao joined as a mentor, contributing elements of his planned script on Lord Krishna and providing creative inputs to the project.[43][44]\n",

      "Rajendra Prasad,[54] Shobhana,[55] Saswata Chatterjee,[56] Brahmanandam,[57] and Pasupathy were cast in important roles.[58] Anna Ben made her Telugu debut with this film.[59] Keerthy Suresh and Arjun Das appeared in voice roles respectively; former as Bujji and latter as Lord Krishna.[60][61] Initially, Keerthy Suresh was offered another undisclosed role, but she rejected it and later accepted the voice-role.[62] Harshith Malgireddy, Kavya Ramachandran, Ayaz Pasha, Anil George, Keya Nair, Vinay Kumar, Venkata Ramana, Hamish Boyd and Sanghawa Shin were present during the film's preliminary shooting schedule.[63] Dulquer Salmaan, Vijay Deverakonda, Mrunal Thakur, S.

The website's consensus reads: \"A colourful spectacle that competes with Hollywood blockbusters while retaining its own distinctive flavor, Kalki 2898 AD marks a rousing breakthrough in Tollywood sci-fi cinema.\"[169] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 65 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[170]\n",

The surprise cameos, even though leaked by Prabhas himself, were perfect theatrical moments.\"[175] Collider in its review said, \"Kalki 2898 AD is a unique sci-fi epic that successfully combines supernatural elements with cutting-edge technology\", while appreciating performances of the lead cast particularly Prabhas and Bachchan, and the screenplay by Nag Ashwin.[176]\n",

The setup and the universe are brilliant, however, the writing needs introspection.\"[179] Avad Mohammed of OTTPlay gave 3/5 stars and wrote, \"On the whole, Kalki 2898 AD is a technically brilliant film with never-before-seen visuals in an Indian film.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Context Window Limitations\n",
    "- **Problem**: Models have token limits (4096, 8192, etc.)\n",
    "- **Solution**: Limit retrieval with `search_kwargs={\"k\": 2}`\n",
    "- **Result**: Balanced context quality and token efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Relevance vs Quantity\n",
    "- **Problem**: More context isn't always better\n",
    "- **Solution**: Smart retrieval focusing on most relevant chunks\n",
    "- **Result**: Higher quality answers with focused context\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Scalability\n",
    "- **Problem**: Large document collections need efficient search\n",
    "- **Solution**: FAISS vector database with semantic indexing\n",
    "- **Result**: Fast similarity search across millions of documents\n",

    "## Production Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chunk Size**: Balance detail vs context window\n",
    "- **Retrieval Count**: Start with k=2-3, adjust based on model capacity\n",
    "- **Embedding Quality**: Use appropriate embedding models for domain\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when context exceeds limits\n",
    "- **Monitoring**: Track retrieval quality and response accuracy"
